# codmetric_To_Do_List_Manager

Developed as part of my internship at **Codmetric (July–August 2025)**, this project is a **command-line To-Do List Manager** that allows users to create, delete, view, and mark tasks as completed — with all tasks saved to a text file for persistence across sessions.
